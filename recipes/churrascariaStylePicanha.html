        <h2>What is Picanha?</h2>
        <p>This churrascaria-style picanha recipe is my version of a favorite steak found in Brazilian steakhouses. Serve with a tomato vinaigrette.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cloves garlic cloves, crushed, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 pound beef top sirloin, trimmed of excess fat</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix crushed garlic and salt together in a bowl until it makes a paste.</li>
            <li>Rub garlic paste all over meat. Place in a bowl; cover with lemon juice. Marinate 30 minutes to 4 hours. Remove meat from lemon juice. Baste with olive oil.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Cook meat on the preheated grill, turning frequently until outer edges are charred, but center is still raw, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; slice off charred edges, cutting against grain.</li>
            <li>Return raw meat to the grill. Cook until meat is firm and slightly pink in the center, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
