        <h2>What are Birria Tacos?</h2>
        <p>Birria, a.k.a. tacos de birria, is a Mexican dish of meat (usually goat or beef) stewed in its braising liquid until it reaches a melt-in-your-mouth texture. Traditionally, it gets its flavor from dried chile peppers. Birria can be served alone as a stew or on corn tortillas.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>These are the ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated birria tacos recipe:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dried chile peppers</strong>: The flavorful birria starts with dried guajillo chile peppers, chile de arbol peppers, and ancho chiles. For a bit of extra heat, don't remove all the seeds.</li>
            <li><strong>Beef</strong>: Beef chuck roast is perfect for braising for hours. When you're done, the meat will shred incredibly easily.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasonings</strong>: You'll need salt, pepper, fresh garlic, whole cloves, cinnamon, cumin, thyme, marjoram, and oregano.</li>
            <li><strong>Olive oil</strong>: Sear the meat in olive oil before you add the braising liquid.</li>
            <li><strong>Tomatoes</strong>: Grill Roma tomatoes before blending them with other ingredients to unlock extra layers of flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Vinegar</strong>: Two tablespoons of white vinegar adds even more acidity to the braising liquid.</li>
            <li><strong>Tortillas</strong>: Use store-bought or homemade corn tortillas.</li>
            <li><strong>Onion</strong> and <strong>cilantro</strong>: Finish each taco with chopped onion and fresh cilantro for a final punch of flavor and texture.</li>
        </ul>
